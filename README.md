A historical look into cryptocurrency for a data visualization final project
A cool little project that I did with Matthew Days that features a d3 stream graph to visualize a cryptocurrency's net worth
against other cryptocurrencies and a line graph to compare various other economic indexes to google popularity ratings.

Data was courtesy of https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory as of the 2017 when we did the project.
